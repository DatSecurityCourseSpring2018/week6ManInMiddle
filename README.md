# Man in the middle & asymetric encryption
The plan for this week and the next is to look at asymetric encryption, and in particular look at the one named RSA. 

The overall principle is explained well by this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4

After having seen that video, I suggest you read through the wikipedia page on public key cryptography: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography

At class we will examine the RSA algorithm more closely, and we will try to measure time for some of the involved algorithms to see why they are hard to break.

Asymetric encryption is used as a key element in SSH, SSL, and basically everywhere you need to avoid man in the middle attacks.

Next week we will look at the more practical aspects of setting up certificates and keystores.
